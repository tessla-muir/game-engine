# 2D Game Engine

## Overview
I developed a custom 2D game engine from scratch using C++ and SDL, designed to support the creation of 2D games with a focus on performance and flexibility. The engine uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, which facilitates efficient and modular game development.

## Key Features
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture**: The ECS model enhances flexibility and scalability by decoupling game logic from game entities. This allows for easier management and expansion of game features.
- **Entity Tagging and Grouping**: Supports tagging and grouping of entities, allowing for efficient management and querying of related game objects.
- **Comprehensive System Implementation**: Designed and integrated systems for rendering, animation, movement, collision detection, damage handling, lifetime management, scoring, and user interface.
- **Persistent Event Handling**: Implements a robust event handling system that ensures smooth communication between different parts of the engine, improving the responsiveness and interactivity of the games developed with it.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved cache efficiency and reduced memory fragmentation by packing components into contiguous data structures and using efficient indexing and resizing techniques.
- **Asset Management System**: Managed game assets such as sprites and fonts, facilitating easy loading, unloading, and accessing of resources
- **Developer Tools**: Integrated a logging system, debugger, and unit testing to ensure reliability and facilitate troubleshooting.

## Projects and Demonstrations
Using this game engine, I developed a Space Invaders-like game that showcases the engineâ€™s capabilities. The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and dynamic gameplay, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ECS architecture and the robustness of the systems implemented.
